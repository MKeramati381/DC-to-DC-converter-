This Simulink model represents a unipolar DC-to-DC converter designed for one-directional power flow, commonly used in power electronics systems to regulate DC voltage levels. It likely employs a full-bridge topology, which is ideal for handling high-power applications with efficient voltage conversion. The model simulates key functions such as stepping up or stepping down voltage and may include control mechanisms like Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) to ensure stable and precise output. Such systems are typically utilized in renewable energy, battery management, and industrial power systems.
